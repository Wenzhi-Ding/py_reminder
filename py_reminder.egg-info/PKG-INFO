Description: # py_reminder
        This is a Python decorator that can send email for various purpose.
        
        ## Introduction
        Often times we have some time-consuming task, and we want to leave it run alone without staring at the screen for 7\*24 hours.
        
        This package will offer you a **one-line** experience (a function decorator) of sending you email report with customized information.
        
        So that you can catch a coffee break / go dating / play Dota2 without worrying about your machine learning / web-scraping / crazy robot. Because you can always get key update through your cell phone.
        
        This is definitely a easy function, I believe many guys have written their own equivalent one. What I did is to simplify it into a decorator, so it is now even more convenient!
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install -U py_reminder
        ```
        
        ## Initial configuration
        **You will suggest to use a unimportant mail box to receive message**, since the password is going to store in plain text. (or if someone knows how to encrypt, please help!)
        
        For the first time, you should specify configuration
        ```python
        from py_reminder import config
        
        config(address='your_email@example.com',
               password='123456',
               smtp='smtp.example.com',
               port=999,
               default_to='receiver@example.com')
        ```
        You can ignore `default_to`. It will set to be the same as `address` by default.
        
        If you receive a testing email, then the configuration is done. You can never include this code thereafter.
        
        ## Sample code
        ```python
        from py_reminder import monitor
        
        @monitor(task='do something', to='receiver@example.com')
        def foo()
          time.sleep(10)
          return 0
         
        foo() 
        ```
        You can ignore `to` if you send to your default receiver. So the most simple way to use this decorator is:
        
        ```python
        @monitor('do something')
        ```
        
        And you will see
